## Project Structure
- Organize your project into clear directories:
    - `/src` - for all source code files.
    - `/assets` - for images, sprites, audio, etc.
    - `/data` - for JSON files and other persistent data.
    - `/docs` - for documentation and guides.

## Modular Design
- Use modular classes to separate concerns:
    - **Character** - Attributes, stats, skills, and inventory.
    - **Monster** - Enemy behavior, attributes, and AI.
    - **Skill** - Skill properties and effects.
    - **Job** - Job trees, passives, and bonuses.

## Game Suggestions

### Text-Based Game Suggestions
1. **Story and World-Building**:
   - Focus on a deep narrative with branching paths and lore.
2. **Player Interaction**:
   - Implement dynamic dialogues and meaningful choices.
3. **Combat and Skills**:
   - Create turn-based combat with descriptive effects.
4. **Inventory and Items**:
   - Provide detailed descriptions and crafting systems.
5. **Quests and Events**:
   - Design engaging quests and limited-time events.
6. **Feedback and UI**:
   - Ensure clear feedback and a clean text interface.

### Sprite-Based Game Suggestions
1. **Visual Style**:
   - Choose a consistent art style and unique character designs.
2. **Sprite Animation**:
   - Develop fluid animations and visual effects for actions.
3. **Environment Design**:
   - Create explorable maps and interactive objects.
4. **Combat System**:
   - Implement a sprite-based combat system with clear status effects.
5. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Design an intuitive HUD and informative tooltips.
6. **Sound and Music**:
   - Add background music and sound effects for immersion.

## Development Planning
- Outline a timeline with milestones for each feature:
    - **Phase 1**: Core mechanics (stats, combat, skills).
    - **Phase 2**: Story and quests development.
    - **Phase 3**: UI/UX design and testing.
    - **Phase 4**: Polishing and optimization.

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize your game through:
    - Efficient data structures for storing game state.
    - Lazy loading of assets to improve load times.
    - Minimizing redraws and optimizing rendering logic.

## Community Engagement
- Build a community around your game through forums and social media.
- Encourage feedback and discussion to enhance player experience.
